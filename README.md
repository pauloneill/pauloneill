Deploying dotNet Core 5.0 and SQL Server 2019 to Linux bwahahaha

✈️ I love travelling as well, even though covid cancelled our first trip to Italy, hopefully we'll be back in the air soon.
My last trip was to Paris, France in 2019. J'adore Paris!!!

⚡ Fun fact: I❤️shoes!
- Ever since our first trip to Bangkok I have become obsessed with funky shoes.
- And more recently I discovered boots with heels after helping a friend sort out the inventory for his online store.
- So happy that Cuban Heels are currently in fashion lol
